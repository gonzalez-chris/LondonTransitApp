<b>Note:</b>This application has not been updated in two years and now runs on an unsupported version of Expo. The app is being rewritten to connect with [london_transit_backend](https://github.com/gonzalez-chris/transit_app_backend) and so that the code and structure of code isn't so horrible.

## Real-Time London Transit App

This app was created using [Expo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent). It has not yet been published to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. On an Android device, you can use this app by downloading [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) from the Google Play Store, and then clicking [here](https://expo.io/--/to-exp/exp%3A%2F%2Fexp.host%2F%40chris_g%2Flondontransitapp). Alternatively, you can scan the QR code at the bottom of the page once you have downloaded Expo Go. Due to Apple's terms of service, it is not currently possible to run this app on an external iOS device.
